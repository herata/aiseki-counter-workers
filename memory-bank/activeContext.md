# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Status: COMPLETED ✅
All requested features have been successfully implemented and the dashboard is production-ready.

## Recent Changes Summary

### Phase 1: Core UX Improvements (Completed)
1. **Calendar Auto-Close Functionality**
   - ✅ Implemented `calendarOpen` state management
   - ✅ Added `setCalendarOpen(false)` in date selection handler
   - ✅ Calendar now automatically closes when user selects a date

2. **UI Simplification & Polish**
   - ✅ Removed Y-axis label "人数" from charts for cleaner appearance
   - ✅ Optimized graph margins (reduced left margin from 16px to 8px)
   - ✅ Removed card wrapper from selection controls
   - ✅ Centered all selection elements for better visual hierarchy
   - ✅ Simplified header text for focused messaging

### Phase 2: Responsive Design Enhancement (Completed)
3. **Mobile Layout Optimization**
   - ✅ Prefecture and store selectors now display horizontally on all screen sizes
   - ✅ Consistent flex layout prevents vertical stacking on mobile
   - ✅ Improved space utilization across devices

4. **Component Styling Consistency**
   - ✅ Updated PrefectureSelect styling to match date picker
   - ✅ Updated ShopSelect styling to match date picker  
   - ✅ Applied consistent `border-input bg-background text-foreground` classes

### Phase 3: Smart Defaults & UX Polish (Completed)
5. **Fixed Layout Height Issues**
   - ✅ Added responsive min-height classes: `min-h-[400px] sm:min-h-[500px] md:min-h-[600px]`
   - ✅ Prevents layout shifts between loading, error, and data states

6. **Smart Date Logic Implementation**
   - ✅ Implemented `getDefaultDate()` function with 18:00 cutoff
   - ✅ Before 6PM = yesterday's data (business logic requirement)
   - ✅ After 6PM = today's data
   - ✅ Uses `subDays` from date-fns for reliable date calculation

7. **Date Validation**
   - ✅ Added `disabled={(date) => date > new Date()}` to prevent future date selection
   - ✅ Business logic constraint properly enforced

## Current Architecture State

### Component Structure (Stable)
```
page.tsx (Main Dashboard)
├── Selection Controls (Centered Layout)
│   ├── PrefectureSelect (Consistent Styling)
│   ├── ShopSelect (Consistent Styling)
│   └── DatePicker (Auto-close + Smart Defaults)
└── Chart Container (Fixed Height + Error Handling)
```

### Key State Management
```typescript
// Smart default date with business logic
const getDefaultDate = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  const currentHour = now.getHours();
  return currentHour < 18 ? subDays(now, 1) : now;
};

// Calendar visibility management
const [calendarOpen, setCalendarOpen] = useState(false);
```

### Data Flow (Optimized)
1. **Smart Defaults**: Auto-select appropriate date based on current time
2. **User Selection**: Prefecture → Store → Date (or Date first)
3. **API Request**: Triggered when all required parameters available
4. **Data Display**: Charts with current + previous week comparison
5. **State Persistence**: Selections maintained during session

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design Philosophy Applied
- **Minimalism**: Removed all non-essential UI elements
- **Efficiency**: Smart defaults reduce user friction  
- **Consistency**: Unified styling across all components
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first with desktop enhancements

### Business Logic Integration
- **Time-based Defaults**: 18:00 cutoff aligns with business operations
- **Date Restrictions**: Future dates disabled per business requirements
- **Auto-close Behavior**: Reduces interaction steps for mobile users

### Performance Optimizations Active
- **Fixed Heights**: Prevent layout shifts and improve perceived performance
- **Responsive Design**: Consistent experience across all devices
- **Smart State Management**: Minimal re-renders through proper state design

## Next Steps (None Required)
All requested features have been successfully implemented. The dashboard is now:
- ✅ Feature-complete according to requirements
- ✅ Mobile-responsive with horizontal layout preservation
- ✅ Polished with consistent styling and smart defaults
- ✅ Performance-optimized with fixed layouts
- ✅ Production-ready

## Files in Current Working State
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Main dashboard component (All features implemented)
- `/src/components/PrefectureSelect.tsx` - Styled consistently
- `/src/components/ShopSelect.tsx` - Styled consistently
- All other components remain stable and functional

The project has successfully achieved all stated goals and is ready for production deployment.
